# California_Green_House_Gas_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of California's Green House Gas emissions. The data set is taken from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/state-agency-co2e-e54e9.


### Motivation
This Analysis was a chance to explore data about California's Co2 Equivalent emissions. 
I attempt to answer several questions ways that the data collection can improve. 

### Running on local machine
If you are interested in running/improving the code on a local machine a ` requirements.txt` and `environmental.yml` file is provided. 
If you are using Anaconda then run this code:
`conda env create -f environmental.yml`
it will create a new virtual environment named `data_analysis`
to activate the environment run : `conda activate data_analysis`
