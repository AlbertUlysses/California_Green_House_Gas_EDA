Exploratory Data Analysis of California's Green House Gas emissions. The data set is taken from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/state-agency-co2e-e54e9.


### Motivation
This Analysis was a chance to explore data about California's Co2 Equivalent emissions. The purpose is explain where most of the California's Agencies Co2E is coming from. 
I attempt to answer several questions and look at ways that the data collection can improve to better answer some of the questions.
