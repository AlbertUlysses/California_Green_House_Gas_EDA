# California_Green_House_Gas_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of California's Green House Gas emissions. The data set is taken from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/state-agency-co2e-e54e9.
## Project introduction:
California Environmental Protection Agency accounts for Greenhouse Gas emissions throughout the state. 
It uses the web-based Climate Registry Information System tool to calulate the Carbon Dioxide Equivalent. 
Agencies have the option to either aggergate their data or submit individual portions. 
In this Exploratory Data Analysis we are going to look at the different sources and the trends of which CO2e is produced. 

### Getting Started:
I suggest that the user either have `Anaconda` installed on their machine, and have experience with working with `conda env` or know how to use `virtualenv` and have experience with creating virtual environments with a `requirements.txt` file. 

### Running on local machine
If you are interested in running/improving the code on a local machine a ` requirements.txt` and `environmental.yml` file is provided. 
If you are using Anaconda then run this code:
```conda env create -f environmental.yml```
it will create a new virtual environment named `data_analysis`
to activate the environment run : 
```conda activate data_analysis```
